    <i>Maps</i> is a series of digital transformations of Emily Dickinson's poem
    "I cross till I am weary" (c. 1862). Six variations on the poem were created
    using Carnegie Mellon University's speech recognition software suite
    <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/">Sphinx</a>.
    Sphinx's workflow includes the ability to define the corpus (or body of text)
    from which Sphinx will choose its vocabulary when rendering a speech recording into text.
    When given a verbally distinct corpus, Sphinx "maps" the sounds of the
    original poem onto the closest available phonemes in the new vocabulary.
    The cadence and inflection of the poem echo in new words that are often radically
    different from the original text.
