I cross till I am weary<br>
A Mountain — in my mind —<br>
More Mountains — then a Sea —<br>
More Seas — And then<br>
A Desert — find —<br><br>

And My Horizon blocks<br>
With steady — drifting — Grains<br>
Of unconjectured quantity —<br>
As Asiatic Rains —<br><br>

Nor this — defeat my Pace —<br>
It hinder from the West<br>
But as an Enemy's Salute<br>
One hurrying to Rest —<br><br>

What merit had the Goal —<br>
Except there intervene<br>
Faint Doubt — and far Competitor —<br>
To jeopardize the Gain?<br><br>

At last — the Grace in sight —<br>
I shout unto my feet —<br>
I offer them the Whole of Heaven<br>
The instant that we meet —<br><br>

They strive — and yet delay —<br>
They perish — Do we die —<br>
Or is this Death's Experiment —<br>
Reversed — in Victory?<br><br>
